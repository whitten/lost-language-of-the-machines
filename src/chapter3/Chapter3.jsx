Fall is always Flamey’s favorite season. The trees of green and skies of blue always put his mind at ease. On his way to the Art Studio, his mind was filled with thoughts about the art project he was going to do that day.
</p>


<p className="mb-3">
“Hi Flamey!” A familiar, cheerful voice came from behind. His friend, Starlax, approached him quickly on her jetpack. “Are we in the same class again?”
</p>

<p className="mb-3">
“Apparently,” Flamey said. “Art is my favorite subject.”
</p>

<p className="mb-3">
The two friends entered the studio together. It was still early, and the room was quite empty - except for Prof. Evergreen, who was sitting behind a painting and working on something. The studio was a marvel of future design, with hovering easels and holographic canvases that responded to the touch of a brush.
</p>

<p className="mb-3">
“Oops,” Flamey exchanged a quick look with Starlax, calculating the possibility of having Evergreen as a substitute for their art teacher.
</p>

<p className="mb-3">
“Oh, you two,” Prof. Evergreen noticed them. “Did you get the notice that the art class has been moved to 3pm? I am borrowing this room to finish a piece of art of mine before the class starts.”
</p>

<p className="mb-3">
“No,” Flamey and Starlax shook their heads. Apparently, the notification system on the campus had malfunctioned again. Now they had one extra hour in the studio.
</p>

<p className="mb-3">
Starlax pulled out her screenbook and started to do some sketching. Meanwhile, Flamey’s attention was drawn to a fighting scene that Prof. Evergreen was drawing.
</p>
<p className="mb-3">
“What are they fighting with?” Flamey couldn’t hold back his curiosity any longer.
</p>

<p className="mb-3">
“Oh, that is a scene from an old movie named Star Wars. They are fighting with Lightsabers, sword-like weapons made of lasers,” Prof. Evergreen answered. “It is a fascinating idea, but scientists nowadays still can’t find a way to make light stop mid-air,” he added.
