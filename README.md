# Lost Language of the Machines

_This book is currently in the creation phase._

## Introduction
In a world half a millennium in the future, where computer science as we know it has become the stuff of legends, two unlikely students embark on a journey through the annals of ‘ancient’ programming. Meet Flamey, a robot with a flair for debate, styled in the charming fashion of yesteryear’s technology. His settings? Permanently toggled to ‘teenager mode.’ Alongside him is Starlaxverse, a human girl whose heart melts at the slightest hint of cuteness. Guiding these two through the forgotten lore of loops and logic is Prof. Evergreen, a scholar as steadfast as his name suggests, yet facing the modern-day plight of filling classroom seats. Together, they’ll decode the mysteries of a bygone digital era and perhaps discover more about themselves in the process.
