<p className="mb-3 first-line:uppercase first-line:tracking-widest first-letter:text-7xl first-letter:font-bold first-letter:me-3 first-letter:float-start">Flamey dashed into the History Hall, his metal feet rattling on the carbon fiber floor. He quickly glanced at the displays on his time tracker, wondering if he was late for his first day of Archaeology: Programmatic and Computational Studies of the Past class. He felt a tug on his arm and turned to see Starlaxverse, his best human friend.</p>

<p className="mb-3">“Oh, Flamey, I’m so relieved you’re here!” Starlaxverse exclaimed, dragging him along. “Professor Evergreen is known to be a person with ATTITUDE.”</p>

<p className="mb-3">Flamey groaned. He wouldn’t have signed up for this class if he had a choice. It was known to be dull and perplexing. Why did he have to learn about the old languages from the Controlled Age that ancient computers used to speak? The textbook listed a lot of strange names like Binary, Assembly, C, Python, Javascript blah blah. They went extinct 500 years ago!</p>

<p className="mb-3">They entered the room through a glass door, where Prof. Evergreen was sitting behind his desk with lots of empty chairs. As expected, they were the only two students today.</p>

<p className="mb-3">“Well,” he muttered. “I guess I have to adapt, otherwise this class will not be offered next year. As history has taught us, modern kids have no patience for long lectures. For today’s topic –Binary, how about I start with a poem?”</p>

<p class="mb-3 text-center">
Oh, Binary, the language of simplicity, <br/>
With only 1 and 0, you create infinite possibilities. <br/>
From two digits, a power grows <br/>
Of logic, number, art, and code.<br/>
</p>

<p className="mb-3">Flamey and Starlaxverse looked at each other, not sure what to say. With the eager look of their professor waiting for feedback on his “new” style of teaching, Flamey slowly raised his hand and opened up: “Err… I want to know why Binary was invented? Why didn't ancient computers use NORMAL math, like 1,2,3,4,5…?”</p>
